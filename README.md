# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

##Styling
I used bootstrap to style the project.

##Testing
to test if the app works, try inserting `49090` as the value of zip code and write any thing in the content section.
